      Grep App: The Grep app is a Java-based application that searches for a text pattern recursively within a given directory and outputs the matched lines to a file. It leverages core Java concepts, the SLF4J logging framework, and Java streams for efficient processing. The app has been dockerized for easier distribution and deployment.
      Stock Quote App: The stock quote app is a Java-based application that allows users to retrieve and manage stock market data. It uses OkHttp to fetch real-time stock prices from an external API, and Jackson to parse the JSON responses. The application stores stock and transaction information in a MySQL database, interacting with it through JDBC. JUnit 5 is used for testing, while SLF4J with Logback handles logging, and Maven manages project dependencies and builds.
