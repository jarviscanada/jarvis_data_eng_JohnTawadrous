It leverages core Java concepts, the SLF4J logging framework, and Java streams for efficient processing. The app has been dockerized for easier distribution and deployment.\nStock Quote App: The stock quote app is a Java-based application that allows users to retrieve and manage stock market data. It uses OkHttp to fetch real-time stock prices from an external API, and Jackson to parse the JSON responses. The application stores stock and transaction information in a MySQL database, interacting with it through JDBC. JUnit 5 is used for testing, while SLF4J with Logback handles logging, and Maven manages project dependencies and builds.\n",
