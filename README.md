## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JohnTawadrous.git](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JohnTawadrous.git)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JohnTawadrous.git/tree/master/linux_sql)]: The project aims to develop a monitoring application for gathering and storing hardware information and usage statistics from multiple Linux hosts into a PostgreSQL database.
This application targets system administrators and DevOps engineers who need to monitor system performance metrics over time.
Technologies used include Bash scripting for automation, Docker for containerization of PostgreSQL, Git for version control, and SQL for database operations.


**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_JohnTawadrous.git/tree/master/core_java)]: Grep App: The Grep app is a Java-based application that searches for a text pattern recursively within a given directory and outputs the matched lines to a file. It leverages core Java concepts, the SLF4J logging framework, and Java streams for efficient processing. The app has been dockerized for easier distribution and deployment.
Stock Quote App: The stock quote app is a Java-based application that allows users to retrieve and manage stock market data. It uses OkHttp to fetch real-time stock prices from an external API, and Jackson to parse the JSON responses. The application stores stock and transaction information in a MySQL database, interacting with it through JDBC. JUnit 5 is used for testing, while SLF4J with Logback handles logging, and Maven manages project dependencies and builds.



## Highlighted Projects
**Sport Betting Application (OkayBetMate)**: OkayBetMate is a dynamic sports betting application built with a modern tech stack, including Spring Boot for the backend, MySQL for database management, React for the frontend, and AWS for cloud deployment.
The app allows users to engage in 1v1 betting contests by submitting their predictions through Bet Slips.
These slips are compared within each matchup, and the user with the most accurate predictions wins.
The combination of these technologies ensures a responsive, scalable, and user-friendly platform for sports enthusiasts to challenge each other.
